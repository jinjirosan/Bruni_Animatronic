# Bruni_Animatronic

Last time I was at Disneyland Paris and saw various Disney and Pixar characters used as shoulder plushies. They were so cute and popular that they were sold out by the time I got to the gift shop. Inspired by Disney's Imagineers and animatronic artists, I decided to buy one online and make it totally unique for our next trip to Disney. I wanted to create an animatronic shoulder plushie of Bruni, the fire-breathing salamander from Frozen. 
With the help of a Pimoroni Pico LiPo, Tower Pro SG92R animatronic driver, Flora Neopixel, and kitelight bright EL-Wire, I was able to bring Bruni to life. I used MicroPython v1.19.1 to code the movements and light effects, and now Bruni is ready to accompany us on our next Disney adventure.
