# Bruni Animatronic

Last time I was at Disneyland Paris and saw various Disney and Pixar characters used as shoulder plushies. They were so cute and popular that they were sold out by the time I got to the gift shop. Inspired by Disney's Imagineers and animatronic artists, I decided to buy one online and make it totally unique for our next trip to Disney. 


I wanted to create an animatronic shoulder plushie of Bruni, the fire-breathing salamander from Frozen. With the help of a Pimoroni Pico LiPo, Tower Pro SG92R servo, Flora Neopixel, and kitelight bright EL-Wire, I was able to bring Bruni to life. I used MicroPython v1.19.1 to code the movements and light effects, and now Bruni is ready to accompany us on our next Disney adventure.

## hardware platform (v1.1-2023/04 for codebase v4-x.x)
- Pimoroni Pico Lipo 4Mb board
- Galleon LiPo 3.7v - 400 mAh (in hardcase shell)
- TowerPro SG92R servo to control the tailwagging motion
- Adafruit Flora RGB Neopixel V2
- two microswitches (clickety-click textile style), one in each front paw
- 18mm sewable Neo-Dymium magnet (can hold 1.9kg) for Bruni
- 18mm sewable Neo-Dymium magnet + 25mm Neo-Dymium magnet (can hold 3.1kg) for shoulder patch base.

## Bruni in action
- The microswitch in his front-right-paw activates the flame. The flame simulates a 'natural' fire-breathing dragon in purple-pink flames in various brightness.
- The microswitch in his front-left-paw activates his tail-wagging-function. The tailwag is simulating 'natural' behavior in 4 stages (2 to the left and 2 to the right). The anagle or range of each wag is randomized.

## Build process

A not-so-short impression of the build process going from 'just' the pluche animal to the animatronic version.
